# Freelease's C++ coding challenges

## Getting Started
If you just want to try yourself on solving the challenges, hop into the `descriptions` folder to see the descriptions of the challenges. Your should be able to view the PDFs in your browser.

If you want to do test your code after writing it, you should download the repository or a release. The folder `tests` contains some files for testing your code for each challenge.

**Note:** When writing the main function in your program, please write `int main(int argc, char** argv)` for declaring the main function. If you do not do this, the testing procedures might not work and throw weird errors.

## Structure
Some coding challenges are split into several parts. You can try any part you like but it is recommended you do them in order.

Every challenge folder and file is written in the format: `[DIFFICULTY]_NAME_PARTS`

For example, an easy challenge called “Printing to the console” with two parts might look like this: `[A]_Printing to the console_2`

There are three difficulties:
- `[A]` Amateur (the easiest & shortest)
- `[E]` Experienced (a happy medium)
- `[S]` Skilled (the hardest one)

Feel free to attempt any difficulty. If you get stuck, just try a different challenge. There is not such thing as failing. There is just learning.

## Testing your code

You can test the code you have written by including the `testing.hpp` header into your `main.cpp`.
